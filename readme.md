## Structure

The applications are located as follows:
- main: localhost:9000 -> /main
- client A: localhost: 9100, -> /client
- client B: localhost: 9200, -> /clientB
- workspace app: localhost:9300 -> /workspace
- server: localhost:4224 -> /server

There is an available workspace layout saved: "example".

The main has multiple applications and layouts config options commented out for easy access and testing.

Each app as it is right now initializes the workspaces API.4
